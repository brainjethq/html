# HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundational language for creating web pages and applications. It provides the structure and content of a webpage, dictating how elements like text, images, and links are displayed in a browser.

## Here's a quick overview of HTML:

### Key Features:  

**Elements:** These are the building blocks of HTML pages. They are represented by tags enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<img>`).  
**Tags:** These define the type of element and its properties. There are opening tags (e.g., `<p>`) and closing tags (e.g., `</p>`).  
**Attributes:** These provide additional information about an element, such as its source (src for images) or styling (style).  
**Structure:** HTML documents have a hierarchical structure, with elements nested within each other. This defines the relationships between different parts of the page.  
**Basic Structure of an HTML document:**

#### HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Heading</h1>
  <p>Paragraph text.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

`<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type and version of HTML.  
`<html>`: The root element of the document.  
`<head>`: Contains metadata about the page (not displayed in the browser).  
`<title>`: Sets the title of the page, shown in the browser tab.  
`<body>`: Contains the visible content of the page.
